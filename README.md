This Streamlit application is an AI-powered tool designed to assist writers at Shadee.Care. It helps create emotionally resonant, culturally relevant, and SEO-optimized articles for a youth audience (13-30 years old) by performing live web research and generating comprehensive "Writer's Packs."

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Live Web Research (RAG):** Before writing, the assistant uses Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash to perform live web research, gathering up-to-date facts and statistics to ensure the article is grounded in reality.
-   **Two-Stage AI Pipeline**:
    1.  **Researcher (Gemini Pro)**: Performs web research and synthesizes findings into a factual summary with verified source URLs.
    2.  **Writer (OpenAI GPT-4o Mini)**: Takes the research, trending keywords, and a chosen structure to craft a high-quality draft in the Shadee.Care brand voice.
-   **Automated Internal Link Suggestions**: The assistant uses an AI to generate broad, thematic search queries from the user's specific topic. It then performs a Google site search on `vibe.shadee.care` to find and suggest relevant existing articles for internal linking, boosting on-site SEO.
-   **Trending Keyword Integration**: Optionally integrates with a "Shadee Social Master" Google Sheet to pull trending keywords from various social platforms.
-   **Secure User Login**: Access is protected by a login screen with role-based passwords.
-   **Role-Based Permissions**: Features like publishing to WordPress are only visible to users with the "admin" role.
-   **WordPress Integration**: Send the generated first draft directly to your WordPress site as a 'draft' post with a single click.
-   **Audience Targeting**: Select between 'Youth (13-18)' and 'Young Adults (19-30+)' to automatically tailor the article's tone, slang, and complexity.
-   **Social Media Generator**: Automatically generates ready-to-post content for Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, including hashtags and video scripts.
-   **Automated Data Logging**: Every generated pack, along with the topic, user, keywords, and sources, is automatically saved to a Google Sheet.

🔮 Future Enhancements

This section outlines potential next steps and feature ideas for the project.

    Targeted Audience Personas:
        (Implemented) Writers can now select an audience segment: Youth (13-18) or Young Adults (19-30+).
        Based on the selection, the assistant automatically adjusts tone, language, slang, and search query parameters.

    Social Media Generator:
        (Implemented) Automatically generates tailored posts for Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok based on the article content.

    Deeper WordPress Integration:

        Add UI elements to select the post category or add tags before sending the draft to WordPress.

        Explore functionality to automatically set a featured image.

    Enhanced Research Control:

        Add an optional text area for writers to provide specific research questions to guide the Gemini researcher.

        Implement a "Skip Live Research" checkbox for purely creative topics.

    Cache Management UI:

        Add a button in the sidebar (visible to admins) to manually clear today's keyword cache.
